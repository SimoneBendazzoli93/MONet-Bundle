# nnUNet MONAI Bundle

This repository contains the implementation of the nnUNet MONAI Bundle, with some instructions on how to use it and how to convert a generic nnUNet model to MONAI Bundle format.

For more details about the nnUNet MONAI Bundle, please refer to the Jupyter notebook [nnUNet_Bundle.ipynb](nnUNet_Bundle.ipynb).


## Convert a trained nnUNet model to MONAI Bundle

To convert a trained nnUNet model to MONAI Bundle format, you can start with exporting a nnUNet trained model  with the `nnUNetv2_export_model_to_zip` command. This command will export the model to a zip file that can be used in the conversion process.
```bash
nnUNetv2_export_model_to_zip -d 009 -o Task09_Spleen.zip -c 3d_fullres -tr nnUNetTrainer -p nnUNetPlans -chk checkpoint_final.pth checkpoint_best.pth --not_strict
```
For testing purposes, you can use the `Task09_Spleen.zip` file provided in this repository. This file contains a trained nnUNet model for the Spleen segmentation task, for only the `3d_fullres` configuration and the fold `0`.

Next, you can build the provided Docker image to convert the model to MONAI Bundle format. The Dockerfile is provided in this repository, and you can build the image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t nnunet-monai-bundle-converter .
```
The converter will first convert the nnUNet model to MONAI Bundle format, and then create the corresponding TorchScript model, which can be used for inference with MONAI Deploy.
For testing purposes, you can use the `Task09_Spleen.zip` file provided in this repository and the [nnUNet Bundle template](./nnUNetBundle/):

The instructions to run the converter can be found in the [run_conversion.py](run_conversion.py) file.
